| Jupyter Notebook Application 1     | Weather_Database.ipynb          | Generates a random list of cities and finds the current weather for each city.|
|                   | WeatherPy_challenge.csv         | Output File: contains location and current weather information for the randomly generated set of cities.|
| Jupyter Notebook Application 2     | Vacation_Search.ipynb           | Inputs the city information from application 1 and selects all cities with current weather information that meets the user's destination weather criteria. For each city that meets the destination weather criteria, the application executes a google search-nearby API request to find the nearest hotel for that city. Finally, the application plots these selected cities on a google map with individual location markers for each city.|
|                   | WeatherPy_challenge.csv         | Input Flle: output from application with city location and weather information.|
|                   | WeatherPy_vacation.csv          | Output File: contains location, current weather, and hotel information for cities that meet the user's destination weather criteria.|
|                   | WeatherPy_vacation_map.png      | Output File: image of google location map which displays the location each city that meets the user's destination weather criteria. Each city is represented by a location marker which when clicked is configured to display a popup information window with information about that city.|
|                   | WeatherPy_vacation_map_zoom.png | Output File: a zoomed image of the google location map which shows a close up of a city location marker and the popup information window that displays detailed information for that city.|
|  Jupyter Notebook Application 3    | Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb        | Inputs the city information from application 2 and generates a google directional map displaying a sample of 4 cities that are geographically near each other. Each city is represented by an individual location marker. The city location markers are connected by highlighted roads that can be used to travel between the cities. Also, this application generates a marker layer google map with location markers for each city that are configured to display a popup information window with information about the city when the location marker is clicked.|
|                   | WeatherPy_vacation.csv          | Input File: contains location, current weather, and hotel information for the cities selected by application 2.|
|                   | WeatherPy_travel_map.png        | Output File: image of the google directional map for the 4 selected cities with the cities connected by highlighted roads between them.|
|                   | WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png | Output File: image of the google marker map for the 4 selected cities with  popup informational windows displayed for some of the 4 cities.|

## Jupyter Notebook Applications Overview
### Application 1: Weather_Database.ipynb
#### Input:
None
#### Description:
This application generates a random list of cities and finds the current weather for each city in the random list 
#### Output:
* WeatherPy_challenge.csv
   * A csv file containing the location and current weather the city list generated by the application

### Application 2: Vacation_Search.ipynb
#### Input:
* WeatherPy_challenge.csv 
  * The csv file from Weather_Database.ipynb containing city location and weather information
#### Description:
This application
* Prompts user to enter the weather criteria for the desired travel destination
* Select all cities whose current weather information meets the users's destination weather criteria
* For each city selected:
  * Finds a nearby hotel in each city
  * If no nearby hotel is found, the city is deleted from the list
* Creates a google map with location markers for each city that meets the user's destination weather criteria
   * Configures each location markers to display a popup information window with the following information:
       * The Hotel name for that city
       * The city name 
       * The country abbreviation
       * The current weather description including the current max temperature for that day
#### Output: 
1. WeatherPy_vacation.csv
   * A csv file containing location, weather, and hotel information for the cities that meet the user's destination weather criteria
2. WeatherPy_vacation_map.png
    * A image of the google location map with markers for each city that meets the user's destination weather criteria

### Application 3: Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb
#### Input:
* WeatherPy_vacation.csv
  * Contains location, current weather, and hotel information for the cities selected in application 2.
#### Description:
* Takes a sample of 4 geographically local cities and 
  * Creates a google direction map
  * Creates a google marker map with a marker at the location of each of the 4 cities in the sample
   * Configures city location markers to display a popup information window with the following information:
       * The Hotel name for that city
       * The city name 
       * The country abbreviation
       * The current weather description including the current max temperature for that day

#### Output:
* WeatherPy_travel_map.png
  * Image of the google directional map for the 4 selected cities
